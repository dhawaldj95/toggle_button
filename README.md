##Synopsis

This is a toggle button which can be used in place of a simple checkbox.

##Code Example

This the html part of the checkbox, we have to use this code to make our checkbox as toggle button

<div class="slideTwo">  
  <input type="checkbox" value="None" id="slideTwo" name="check" />
  <label for="slideTwo"></label>
</div>

##Motivation

This I made as a task to make more stylish "checkbox" as there is not much features available to decorate them.

##Installation

This is very simple, just place the css file with your other css files.
Just take care that you place the html code for checkbox in the same way I described above.

Just add the class name to your div element i.e. "slideTwo".
